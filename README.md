# Recipe Estimator
A chrome extension to estimate the price to make different recipes.
## How it works:
By scraping recipe webpages and sending out google search requests, recipe estimator is able to retrieve and display the prices for different ingredients for any recipe.

(Note: this is a learning project to learn how to write React.js in typescript and how to create chrome extensions)
